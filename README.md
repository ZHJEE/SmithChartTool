# SmithChartTool
SmithChartTool is used to observe transformational effects of different microwave elements (such as lumped elements, stubs, transmission lines, etc.) on impedance elements (from load to source).
Since a proprietary Smith-Chart tool included in some high-end software-package literally saved me during Master's thesis I searched for standalone (open-source) Smith-Chart tools for not being reliant upon licenses. I found out, that several tools on the internet are either not "pretty", yet complicated to use, or just not modern enough. 

In this project, I tried my best using MVVM approach in combination with CustomControls, Bindings, Validaters, Drag&Drop functionality and other WPF magic. SmithChartTool projects can be stored and opened from disc, the Smith-Chart itself may be exported to an Image to bring it in your documentation. Impedance or admittance Smith-Charts are generated using Oxyplot.

For private or professional purpose.

WORK IN PROGRESS!!
